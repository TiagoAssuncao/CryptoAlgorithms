# Many cript algorithms

The repository contents a lot of algorithms of ciphers, deciphers and the tools
of they need.



We implemented:

## List 1

* Create a encrypt algorithm(DES)

* Find the multiplicative inverse

* Build a calculator in finite field GF(2^8)

## List 2
* AES algorithm 128 bits

* CFB that uses the AES algorithm of 128 bits
